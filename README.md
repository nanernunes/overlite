**Speak PostgreSQL, store SQLite.** overlite is a lightweight server that talks
the PostgreSQL wire protocol on the front and keeps all your data in a single
SQLite file on the back.

## Why

SQLite is a fantastic storage engine, but it isn't a server: no network access,
brittle locking over network filesystems, and you have to use SQLite-specific
tooling. overlite puts a PostgreSQL-speaking server in front of it so you get:

- **Real network access & concurrency** — one process owns the file and
  serializes access, so the multi-access and network-lock problems disappear.
- **The entire Postgres ecosystem for free** — connect with `psql`, DBeaver,
  and any PostgreSQL driver (pgx, JDBC, …). `\dt`, `\d`, `\copy` all work.
- **Dead simple to run** — a single static binary (pure-Go SQLite, no CGO), no
  server to provision, no data directory. Point it at a file and go.

## Quick start

```sh
$ overlite postgres.db
```

It listens on `:5432` and creates the file if it isn't there. The file name is
the database name, so this one is `postgres`. Connect with any Postgres client:

```sh
psql "postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
```

### Docker

```sh
$ touch postgres.db
$ docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 -v "$(pwd)/postgres.db:/data/postgres.db" nanernunes/overlite postgres.db
```

`touch` first so Docker mounts a file rather than creating a directory in its
place — an empty file is already a valid empty SQLite database. The image binds
`0.0.0.0` inside the container and writes straight through to the file you
mounted, so `postgres.db` stays a plain SQLite file on the host. Podman needs
`:Z` on the mount for SELinux to allow that write.

### compose.yaml

```yaml
services:
  overlite:
    image: nanernunes/overlite
    command: postgres.db
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./postgres.db:/data/postgres.db
```

```sh
$ touch postgres.db
$ docker compose up
```

## Configuration

overlite follows PostgreSQL conventions, so it drops into the same tooling and
container setups.

| Flag | Env | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--driver` | `OVERLITE_DRIVER` | `postgres` | wire protocol to speak |
| `--host` | — | `127.0.0.1` | listen address (`0.0.0.0` to expose) |
| `--db` | — | `postgres.db` | SQLite file; its name becomes the database name |
| — | `POSTGRES_PORT` | `5432` | listen port (the driver's default, e.g. postgres = 5432) |
| — | `POSTGRES_USER` | `postgres` | role shown as owner |
| — | `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | *(unset)* | when set, requires password auth (else trust) |
| — | `POSTGRES_SSL` | *(unset)* | `on` enables TLS with a self-signed cert (clients use `sslmode=require`) |
| — | `POSTGRES_SSL_CERT` / `POSTGRES_SSL_KEY` | *(unset)* | PEM cert/key to serve instead of self-signed |
| — | `OVERLITE_HBA_DIR` | `.` | directory holding `pg_hba.conf` and/or `pg_hba.yaml` (see below); overrides the global auth method |

The port belongs to the driver — postgres defaults to 5432 — and is only
overridden if you set `<DRIVER>_PORT` (e.g. `POSTGRES_PORT`).

```sh
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret POSTGRES_PORT=5544 overlite shop.db
# -> database "shop", user "postgres", password auth, on :5544
```

## Host-based auth (`pg_hba`)

Drop a `pg_hba.conf` (classic Postgres format) or a `pg_hba.yaml` into
`OVERLITE_HBA_DIR` to decide the auth method — or a rejection — per connection,
by type / database / user / client CIDR. Rules are evaluated top-to-bottom;
**the first match wins**, and an unmatched connection is refused (as Postgres
does). If both files are present, `pg_hba.conf` takes precedence.

```conf
# TYPE  DATABASE  USER   ADDRESS         METHOD
host    all       all    127.0.0.1/32    trust
hostssl shop      app    10.0.0.0/8      scram-sha-256
host    all       all    0.0.0.0/0       reject
```

```yaml
hba:
  - { type: host,    database: all,  user: all, address: 127.0.0.1/32, method: trust }
  - { type: hostssl, database: shop, user: app, address: 10.0.0.0/8,   method: scram-sha-256 }
  - { type: host,    database: all,  user: all, address: 0.0.0.0/0,     method: reject }
```

Methods `trust`, `reject`, `scram-sha-256`, `md5`, and `password` are enforced;
`peer`/`cert` are accepted without their verification. Each role authenticates
against **its own password** — `CREATE ROLE alice LOGIN PASSWORD 'x'` stores a
SCRAM verifier (never plaintext), and roles without one fall back to
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

## Schemas

By default all schemas live in the one file — the file you point at is the
`public` schema, and other schemas are name-prefixed tables in it:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA sales;            -- ordinary write (works inside a transaction)
CREATE TABLE sales.orders (...);
SELECT * FROM sales.orders;     -- cross-schema queries & foreign keys just work
ALTER TABLE sales.orders SET SCHEMA archive;   -- move between schemas
ALTER SCHEMA sales RENAME TO revenue;
```

This makes `CREATE`/`DROP SCHEMA` transactional and lets foreign keys cross
schemas. The file stays plain-SQLite readable (`sales.orders` is a table named
`"sales.orders"`).

Set **`OVERLITE_MULTITENANT_SCHEMA=true`** for the alternative model, where each
schema is a *separate attached file* (`shop.db` + `shop.sales.db` +
`shop.audit.db`) for physical per-tenant isolation — auto-discovered on connect.
There schema DDL can't run in a transaction (`ATTACH` can't).

## Status

High level, at a glance — including what's still needed to be **Postgres-ready
for a real production system**. ✅ done · 🟡 partial · ⬜ not yet.

Across the full feature matrix — **157 items: ✅ 142 · 🟡 14 · ⬜ 1**
(90% done, 99% at least partial):

| Area | ✅ | 🟡 | ⬜ |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| Wire protocol | 14 | 0 | 0 |
| Authentication | 9 | 0 | 0 |
| DML (queries) | 12 | 1 | 0 |
| DDL (schema) | 30 | 5 | 0 |
| Data types | 11 | 4 | 0 |
| Transactions | 8 | 1 | 0 |
| Schemas | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| Catalog / introspection | 21 | 1 | 1 |
| Functions & dialect | 21 | 1 | 0 |
| Tooling (psql/pg_dump/GUIs) | 6 | 1 | 0 |

Every ✅ is exercised end-to-end against real `psql` and pgx (`make test`). The
remaining 🟡/⬜ items — the gap to a drop-in production Postgres — are listed in
full under [Limitations](#limitations).

Deciding whether to migrate? [**overlite vs
PostgreSQL**](POSTGRES_ROADMAP.md) goes subsystem by subsystem — what you get,
what is planned, and what will never be there because it belongs to SQLite.

## Limitations

Everything not listed here is implemented (see Status). This is the complete set
of gaps — 🟡 **partial** (works, with caveats) · ⬜ **not implemented**.

### Types

- 🟡 **`numeric` infix arithmetic** — `+` `-` `*` `/` use SQLite's float operators
  (which can't be overridden); storage, ordering, and `sum`/`avg` are exact, and
  `dec_add`/`dec_mul`/… give exact results explicitly. Scale isn't enforced.
- 🟡 **`hstore` `->`** returns the JSON-quoted scalar (use `->>` for text); a bare
  insert needs the `::hstore` cast.
- 🟡 **range & geometric/network types** — ranges work (text-stored, constructors,
  accessors, `@>`, `&&`), but the closed `[a,b]` form is ambiguous with a
  2-element array; `point`/`box`/… and `inet`/`cidr`/`macaddr` aren't modeled.
- 🟡 **enum columns** — enforced via `TEXT` + `CHECK` and reported with the
  enum's own type (so a dump round-trips), but no ordering/comparison.
- 🟡 **composite types** — `CREATE TYPE … AS (…)` shows in `pg_type`/`\dT`, but the
  fields aren't modeled.
- 🟡 **`interval`** — `ts ± interval '1 day'` and `age()` work; no bare `interval`
  value type.
- 🟡 **integer OIDs** — every integer advertises as `int8` and `numeric` as
  `float8` in `RowDescription` (catalog oids exceed `int4`).

### Functions, triggers, extensions

- 🟡 **PL/pgSQL functions / procedures / aggregates** — accepted so migrations
  proceed, but the body isn't executed (no procedural engine). `CREATE FUNCTION …
  LANGUAGE sql` **is** fully supported (executed, shown in `\df`/`\sf`, dumped).
- 🟡 **`CREATE TRIGGER`** — accepted; Postgres trigger functions (PL/pgSQL) aren't
  executed.
- 🟡 **`CREATE`/`DROP EXTENSION`** — a no-op; the common functions (e.g.
  `gen_random_uuid`) are provided directly.

### DDL & constraints

- 🟡 **`information_schema.check_constraints`** — empty (SQLite checks are
  indistinguishable from the enum-backing `IN (…)` checks).

### Query & runtime

- 🟡 **`LATERAL` correlated subquery** — can't reference the left side (a SQLite
  limit); `LATERAL` over set-returning functions works.
- 🟡 **configurable isolation levels** — `SET`/`BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL` accepted,
  no effect (SQLite serializes writes).
- 🟡 **DBeaver** — connects and browses/reads data; full validation in progress.
- ⬜ **planner statistics** (`pg_statistic`, `pg_statistic_ext`) — empty; SQLite
  keeps stats in a different shape (`sqlite_stat1`). (Everything backed by real
  data — `pg_auth_members`, `pg_policy`, `pg_depend`/`pg_shdepend` — is populated.)
